    <h3>

    </h3>
      <p>
        I'm a German-American science fiction nerd. I own a beautiful dog called Callisto
        and a wonderful cat called Lavinia. My fiancee and I are moving to Vancouver, BC in
        September.

        and fantasy related.

    <h3>
      Coding Experience
    </h3>
      <p>
        My coding experience is pretty basic; I have had a tumblr since 2012, and as a result
        learned basic HTML &amp; CSS to keep my tumblr theme looking Cool&trade;. Other than that,
        my last job as a personal assistant had me interact with my boss' SEO people a lot,
        so I learned a nice chunk of stuff from them!

      <h4>
        Life Goals
      </h4>
        <p>My life goal is to give my cat and my dog the life they deserve;

        <p>
          Primarily, I want to get a job in the tech industry. But I also want to help my mom
